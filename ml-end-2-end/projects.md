# Projects

Below are the major influencing projects that shape the contents of this repository.

| Project  |  Description |
|---|---|
|Pill Classification Using Artificial Data Generated in Unity   |What: Use case to assist in 'pill' sorting, which is performed by a human for a pill provider to the NI healthcare sector. The aim was to count the pills, rather than classify the different pills via object detection. How: We lacked data, we generated artificial data using Unity which varied lighting and position etc and attempted to translate to the real world by making the artificial images reflect as closely as possible real pills on a flat white background. Used a Tensorflow CNN to count up to 20 pills. On an artificial dataset is performed well and translated imperfectly but reasonable to a real world small test set.   |
|Asos Social Media Photo Holiday Recommendation   |What: Mock website showing social media linking to analyse photos and recommend a type of holiday. How: Leveraging a Tensorflow neural network to classify social media photos to a fixed subset of holiday types and majority vote on the majority, which is then recommended to the user with a series of matching destinations.
 Prison Service Anomalous Action Detection  |What: Is it possible to use CCTV cameras to detect when a dangerous action has occurred? E.g a fight between a prisoner and a guard. How: Team created a mock video as a target scenario to apply the solution towards. Apply the first iteration of OpenPose open source model to the video feed, perform person detection draw the pose and the person as a bounding box. Take the coordinates of the open pose and translate into 3D, load into Unity as an animated puppet. Estimate direction of the person using the 3D model and draw on the target video. Take a frame by frame photo of the action in Unity. Train a model using a specific dangerous action (swinging arms) using staged videos of fight footage from Youtube. Apply the model to new footage and attempt to classify fight actions using a CNN and a majority vote across frames. Output: human detection, pose extraction, action classification and direction estimation. Aim as to use the social saliency of all people in a scene to also detect anomalous events. https://1drv.ms/p/s!AmILF_EyrHSnqAV6bwS8GcGZb2Fg?e=iUUlwH
|Virtual Driving Test to Determine Deriving Skill / Attention  |Using basic stastical techniques (variance etc.) and coordinate vectors from an eye tracking device is it possible to determine the "skill" of the driver using the proxy of a VR driving test developed in Unity. The solution was tested on dozens of volunteers and shows a general correlation in our selected measures versus the performance of the driver in the virtual test.   |
|RBCH Hospital Auto Coding Project   |What: Leverage ML to ingest text information from Doctors notes on a patients journey and assign the appropriate clinical code, used for billing. How: Multiple on site visits to the hospital in Bournemouth, acquiring data in a CSV for a dozen types of treatment. We showed we could auto match across several dozen codes in a traditional NLP classification faster and better than the human teams.   |
|HMLR Document Comparison   |What: When a person buys a house, the details on the land get sent to HMLR, who compare two versions of the documents for significant changes that have occurred between purchases. This is performed by human teams essentially putting two scanned PDF's side by side on a monitor. Can this be aided by AI/ML? How: Leverage textract to pull out the text in an event driven system with a UI, upload process and multiple Lambdas polling for a Textract result.  The result is added to a RDS database as a pending job, a queue then polls the DB for completed Textract jobs and sends the identifying information to a Lambda called the 'Comparator'. This Lambda component performs a custom diff Algorithm to unearth the differences between documents using an open source Python diff tool, alongside business rules to discover certain types of key entities (names, ids etc) using NER. The diff information is sent to a database, to be populated onto the user interface which has highlighting and navigation features using the NER. https://kainos-prod-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/02/HMLR-Case-Study-2021.pdf   |
|VIN Number Extraction   |What: On an accident the drivers take a photo of their VIN, this is sent to allstate to claim insurance in the Allstate app. A service team gets the photo of the VIN and enters into a separate system. Can we automate this extraction and entry process? 1-2 million dollars in value. How: Custom label a semantic segmentation dataset with Paint, rendering the characters in a VIN in white and the background in Black. Train a UNET model to segment the characters in the VIN from the background. Extract each character into its own image. Feed each image into a CNN to classify the character or number. Use business rules to verify the correctness of the VIN using expected structures. The UNET model runs multiple times agaisnt different variations of the source image, with different preprocessing techniques until the business rules for a correct VIN are met, only then is it accepted. The solution was deployed as an API on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and CI'ed using a Jenkins pipeline. https://1drv.ms/p/s!AmILF_EyrHSnrgoAl4o8m_kUXCdQ?e=SnCw7b   |
|Allstate Customer Call Sentiment Project   |What: Customer called get processed by Amazon text to speech. The company wants to compare sentiment solutions between AWS Comprehend, D3, AICOE and an external party to find the best solution. Custom is expected to trump AWS due to specific domain and accounting for transcription mistakes. How: Ensemble model using UML fit, Spacy and other open source sentiment tools as the inputs to a final model to classify negative, positive and neutral. Challenge in this project came down to imbalanced classes and the importance of positive and negative over neutral for the company, which led to Black listing and other techniques. AICOE model was a large contender in the evaluation and outperformed the AWS Comprehend version by a large margin. The vision was to map a complete customer call journey showcasing all the sentiment beats of a call, to find the low point moments.   |
|Risk Classification For Vehicle Underwriting - Probability of Accident   |What: When customers get car insurance with allstate, some are more risky than other based on the car, location and personal demographic. Can this risk be modelled? How: General logistic model led project which ingests the age, gender, car model, accident history and attempts to predict risk.  The focus of this project was an a large ETL process (querying Hadoop using HIVE and HUE) pulling the data from a database and mapping the data to various counts over their history with Allstate, collecting data like accidents in the last year, total accidents, volume of cars to try to model risk. This was not a classification task, more a probably recommendation at a sufficient cut off point. https://1drv.ms/p/s!AmILF_EyrHSnrgl1glnR4yt0HN8i?e=241FnJ   |
|Clickstream Data for Website Exit Prediction   |Handed over to another ML Engineer.   |
|Product Matching Automation For E-Commerce   |Use ML to automate a human driven "product matching" process that costs $0.02 per decision, with a backlog of pendoing decisions of the size 250 million with a multi million dollar opportunity cost for the organisation. A traditional Machine Learning model was built using traditional text similarity scores and boolean features to determine if a given pair of products match to one another. Language models alongside W2V and other variants were tested during the exploratory process but it was deemed overkill for the solution. High precision was critical in this case as misclassifications proliferated through a network of clients that share information to one another - we achieved 98%+ precision with srrict threshold setting. The soluton used Kedro as the data pipeline and versioning tool (with S3) and the output (ONX) model was packaged into a AWS Lambda using the Serverless framework.  |
