| Metaflow| [https://metaflow.org/](https://metaflow.org/) | Quick and easy to build and manage real-life data science projects.| 23 |  A much tighter integration here -- inetgrates into the notebooks for iterative data science work.

| Kubeflow Pipelines| [https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/introduction/](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/introduction/) | platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning (ML) workflows based on Docker containers. | 21 | [Jobs are written in python decorations like metaflow. Everything runs on a Kube cluster. SageMaker integration exists, but we still need to manage the Kubeflow infrastructure. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-components-for-kubeflow-pipelines/ SageMaker integration - https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/aws/sagemaker Kubeflow vs Metaflow - https://valohai.com/blog/kubeflow-vs-metaflow/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-components-for-kubeflow-pipelines/) | 1 | 1| 1| 1| 1 | 1| 0| 1 | 1| 1| 1|

| MLRun | [https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) | open-source MLOps framework that offers an integrative approach to managing your machine-learning pipelines| 13 |  Been around a while... seems complex? Trying to solve end-to-end MLOps - "Data preparation, model development, model and application delivery, and end to end monitoring are tightly connected" - probably not worth trying to use just their pipeline piece unless we're interested in exploring MLRun more broadly. Uses Kubeflow for pipelines (also offers local option)| 0 | 0| 1| 1| 0 | 1| 0| 1 | 1| 1| 1|
| Kedro | [https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) | Framework for creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. | 12 |  Doesn't manage deployments -- guides for Argo, Prefect, Kubeflow, AWS Batch. We have experimence here -- challenges with ditributing it. Could play nice with sagemaker processing jobs, but we have a slow upstart time for that.
